# Belly_Button_Biodiversity_Deployment
Building an interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to explore data on the biodiversity of belly buttons. Then deploying dashboard on a cloud server.

## Module Overview
In this module, you will use Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web. The completed work will be displayed in a portfolio you create. To be successful in this module, you’ll need to be familiar with HTML and basic JavaScript.

## Project Overview
In this challenge, you will complete the belly button dashboard and deploy a working version to GitHub Pages.

The goals for this challenge are to:
1. Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
2. Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
3. Complete the demographic information panel, if you have not done so.

## Resources

- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.39.0
- Languages: JavaScript, Plot.ly, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## App Preview

You can access the web app here: [Belly Button Biodiversity](https://jbtrahin.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity_Deployment/)

Here is a preview of what the web app looks like once all the charts have been created and are functional:

## Recommendations for further development

Here are some suggestions on what I'd like to tackle next on this project:
- Add a filtering by age range, gender, ethnicity and location.
- Map top 10 OTUS by age range, gender, ethnicity and location.
- Do further analysis on wash frequency vs. number of bacterial species.
